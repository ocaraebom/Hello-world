# Hello-world




My name is Lucas Lopes. I am from Brazil.
\nOne of my biggest dreams was to learn how to program. However, in my country things are a little bit hard because just rich people get access to stuff like that in their early education.
\nBut that's OK. BECAUSE NOW I AM PROGRAMING. ALL I NEED IS THIS GODDAMN LAPTOP AND THIS SHITTY INTERNET.
